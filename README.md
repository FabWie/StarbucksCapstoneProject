# StarbucksCapstoneProject
Udacity Capstone Project which is part of the "DataScience" nanodegree program

## Data & Jupyter Notebook
The project contains 3 json datasets and 1 jupyter notebook.
Datasets are portfolio.json, profile.json and transcript.json, the transcript.json dataset due to its size zipped.
The jupyter notebook is also zipped, due to its size of 48 MB.

A detailed summary of the project can be found as a Medium article in the following link: https://medium.com/@fab.wiegand/starbucks-capstone-project-ca0486d81956

## Project Overview :
The Starbucks Capstone Project is part of the Udacity “Data Science” nanodegree progam. For the project, a dataset based on the Starbucks rewards mobile app was created, which imitates individuals purchasing behavior and the influence of promotional offers on their decision-making processes. Thereby each person has hidden buying incentives that correlate with their observable characteristics. For each Starbuck customer, there are records of various events, such as receiving offers, opening offers and making purchases. To incentivize customers to make additional purchases, three types of offers are available: Discount, BOGO (buy one get one free) and informational (with no reward or spending requirement).

## Problem Statement :
The objective of this project is to explore the different customer characteristis, the events and transactions, as well as the acceptance of promotional offers.
In order to predict if Starbucks member would complete an offer or not, a machine learning model will be build.

## Installations :

This project was implemented in Python, utilizing Jupyter Notebook within the Anaconda environment. The essential Python packages employed in this project include:

- pandas
- numpy
- math
- json
- plotly.express
- plotly.graph_objs
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- sklearn (scikit-learn)
